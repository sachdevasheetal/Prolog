<N = NUMBER OF QUERIES>
<QUERY 1>
…
<QUERY N>
<K = NUMBER OF GIVEN SENTENCES IN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE>
<SENTENCE 1>
…
<SENTENCE K>
 
The first line contains an integer N specifying the number of queries. The following N lines contain
one query per line. The line after the last query contains an integer K specifying the number of
sentences in the knowledge base. The remaining K lines contain the sentences in the knowledge
base, one sentence per line.

Query format: Each query will be a single literal of the form Predicate(Constant_Arguments) or
~Predicate(Constant_Arguments) and will not contain any variables. Each predicate will have
between 1 and 25 constant arguments. Two or more arguments will be separated by commas.

KB format: Each sentence in the knowledge base is written in one of the following forms:
1) An implication of the form p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ... ∧ pm ⇒ q, where its premise is a conjunction of
literals and its conclusion is a single literal. Remember that a literal is an atomic sentence
or a negated atomic sentence.
2) A single literal: q or ~q
